# leviathanK
leviathanK is a project for browsing a Windows registry-like data structure. 
In its foundation there is a tree-like data structure, each node of the tree is identified by a path consisting of a hierarchical sequence of parent nodes separated by a delimiter. You can navigate it using the path to the node via command line, you can set values for its nodes, delete nodes, list the contents of the entire tree and save/restore the tree to/from a file.

**Expected end date for run one** (basic functionality should be finished by that day): 04/30/2020
